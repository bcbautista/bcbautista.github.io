					<h1>• ABOUT ME •</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>My name is Bianca Ruth C. Bautista, nicknamed Bianca, a 19 year-old senior BS Computer Science student in the University of the Philippines, Los Baños. I am the youngest child of Herman and Lorna Bautista. My family lives in Sta. Cruz, Laguna, but because of college, I am presently residing in Westbrook Residences here in Los Baños. Aside from being a student, I am also a digital artist, and most of my works feature either anime characters or marine animals.</p>

					<h1>• WHY COMPUTER SCIENCE? •</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>When deciding on what course I should pursue during college, I was leaning towards choosing something that specializes in art like Animation or Graphics Design. However, both courses were not offered in the University of the Philippines. It was then that I got inspired by my sister, who was still a Computer Science student at UP at the time, and was fascinated by how from some lines of code, a person can make a functioning game or application.</p>

					<h1>• FAVORITE CMSC SUBJECT? •</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>Among all the CMSC subjects that I have taken so far, my favorite would have to be CMSC 165. The subject focuses on digital image processing, and as a digital artist, learning about the different properties of an image and how to enhance them is a huge help. I was able to extract foreground images from the background and group them according to size, color, shape and other characteristics. I was also able to learn how to track moving objects in image frames. Our professor also taught us how to recognize handwritten numbers. Because of this class, I became more interested in the field of image processing to the point that I made it the main focus my SP topic.</p>
					<br/>
					<h1>• FAVORITE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE? •</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>I would say that Java is my favorite programming language. Firstly, this is because creating a user interface for it is much easier for me compared to other languages, and because of this, Java is the language that I used when I made my very first game project. Java is also the language that is used in Android Studio (however Kotlin is much more preferred nowadays), so it was also the language that I used when making mobile applications. I would say that for me, Java is the language that was easiest to learn, understand and get used to, plus it also has a wide variety of uses.</p>
